SINGLETON IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------
- Going to implement different data collection variables:
    - total distance travelled (totalDistTrav)
    - total money made (totalMoney)
    - total number of delivery trips made (totalDelTrips)
    - total number of bank trips made (totalBankTrips)
    - total money deposited (moneyDeposited)
    - bank visits per bank (numVisits)
    - total distance to bank before deposit (totalDistToBank)
    - robot's money spent (tripCost)

- From the variables initially collected, we can find
    - avg. distance per trip
    - avg. money per trip
    - most popular banks
    - avg. money per deposit
    - avg. distance to bank (when depositing is ready, how far does the drone have to go on average?)

- Trends and analysis of variables will all be printed in the CSV file

- Variables: (are we representing money as int or double?)
    - map<Drone, double> totalDistTrav;
    - map<Drone, int> totalMoney;
    - map<Drone, int> totalDelTrips;
    - map<Drone, int> totalBankTrips;
    - map<Drone, int> moneyDeposited;
    - map<Drone, double> totalDistToBank
    - map<Bank, int> numVisits;
    - map<Robot, int> tripCost;

- Functions:
    - writeDeliveryDist(Drone, double)
        - will add delivery distance to total distance
        - only occurs after trip completions, not bank runs
    - writeDroneMoney(Drone, int)
        - will increase total money made
        - only occurs after trip completions, not bank runs
    - writeNumDelTrip(Drone)
        - will increase total delivery trips by 1
        - only occurs after trip completions, not bank runs
    - writeNumBankTrip(Drone)
        - will increase total bank trips by 1
        - only occurs after bank runs, not trip completions
    - writeMoneyDeposited(Drone, int)
        - will increase money deposited
        - only occurs after a bank run
    - writeBankVisit(Bank)
        - will increase the # of visits to the bank
        - only occurs after a bank run
    - writeTripCost(Robot, int)
        - will record the cost of the trip
        - only occurs after a trip is finished
    - writeDistToBank(Drone, double)
        - will record the distance to the bank before bank run
        - only occurs after a trip is finished
    - calcDistPerTrip()
        - will calculate the avg. distance per trip 
        - only occurs when called in writeToCSV()
    - calcMoneyPerTrip()
        - will calculate the avg. money per trip 
        - only occurs when called in writeToCSV()
    - calcPopularBank()
        - will calculate the most popular bank, with visits 
        - only occurs when called in writeToCSV()
    - calcMoneyPerDeposit()
        - will calculate the avg. money deposited each trip
        - only occurs when called in writeToCSV()
    - calcDistToBank()
        - will calculate the avg. trip needed to go to bank
        - only occurs when called in writeToCSV()
    - writeToCSV()
        - File I/O 
        - button click calls the function
        - outputted to "sim_data.csv"

- Thoughts/Notes:
    - is money an int or double?
    - is distance calcs to banks going to be too complex
    - figure out sim_data.csv format
