## Project Overview
#### What is this project about?
This is a drone simulation system, modeling that of a transportation oriented service (like Uber, Lyft, etc.). The drone acts as a taxi, and picks up robots placed around the map that need to get from a point A to a point B. 

The drone can follow several different movement paths using different algorithms such as dijkstra's, DFS, Beeline, and A*. Based on the chosen movement algorithm, the drone will move to these points and complete trips accordingly. 

#### How do you run the simulation?

Copy/pasted from the original readme:

Here is a quick overview of how to run the visualization (If you are using ssh, navigate to ssh category below):

    ```bash
    # Go to the project directory
    cd /path/to/repo/project
    
    # Build the project
    make -j
    
    # Run the project (./build/web-app <port> <web folder>)
    ./build/bin/transit_service 8081 apps/transit_service/web/
    ```
    
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081 and you should see a visualization.

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081/schedule.html and you should see a page to schedule the trips.

*Note: 8081 will depends on what port you used. If you use port 8082, then it will be http://127.0.0.1:8082 instead.*
